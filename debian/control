Description: Compiler for Thrift definition files
 Thrift is a software framework for scalable cross-language services
 development. It combines a software stack with a code generation engine to
 build services that work efficiently and seamlessly.
 .
 Thrift came out of Facebook and is now an Apache Software Foundation project.
 .
 This package contains the Thrift compiler that is used for translating from
 .thrift files (containing the definitions) to the language binding for the
 supported languages.
